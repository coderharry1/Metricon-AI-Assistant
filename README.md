# Metricon HomeIQ — AI Assistant 

Metricon HomeIQ is a POC that explores what it looks like when a home builder uses GenAI to actually answer customer questions, not just point them to a brochure.

It's built on a RAG pipeline using AWS Bedrock Nova and Qdrant, pulling answers directly from Metricon's own documents. Ask it anything about costs, the building process, or first home buyer options, and it tells you exactly where the answer came from.

The idea is simple: if this works for customers, the same approach could help Metricon's internal teams, too. 

Construction, planning, approvals, compliance, any team drowning in documents could use something like this.

### *"Don't just search for answers. Let AI build them for you."*

## 🧠 What Makes This Different

Most RAG pipelines just split text and store it. **ConstructIQ goes further.**

Every single chunk is sent to **AWS Bedrock Nova**, which reads it, understands it, and enriches it with:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `title` | Short descriptive title generated by AI |
| `summary` | 50-word AI-generated summary |
| `keywords` | 5 extracted keywords for better search |
| `category` | Auto-classified topic area |
| `importance` | AI-scored relevance from 1–10 |

This means when a customer asks a question, we're not just doing keyword matching — we're matching against **AI-understood meaning**.
